# Valuation-GUI
Simple GUI platform to Calculate Valuation (1.0)

This is the MVP of a CSR Job Aide for my colleagues. Right now it is a simple Valuation Calculator. 

To use:

1. Enter the estimated weight in the ext field.
2. Click "Calculate!" and see the valuation for your moving estimate at the bottom. (At the moment, you cannot press the 'Enter' key to calculate).

To exit. Click "Exit" or utilize the X in the corner.


Additions that I'd intend to add:

1. LDM Calculator.
2. Time/Punch clock
3. Sales Dashboard
4. TC Sales Update Template
5. Follow up template and form-filler

Please reach out with suggestions.
